# Tate Acyclicity (Wedhorn Theorem 8.28(b))

We define the class `IsStronglyNoetherianTate` (Wedhorn Definition 6.36) and develop
the proof infrastructure for **Theorem 8.28(b)**: strongly noetherian Tate rings are sheafy.

## Main definitions

* `IsStronglyNoetherianTate` : A Tate ring `A` is *strongly noetherian* if
  `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` is noetherian for every `k` (Definition 6.36).

## Main results

* `LaurentCoverAcyclicity.laurentCover_acyclic_discrete` : The 2-element Laurent cover
  is exact for discrete noetherian rings (wraps `LaurentCoverExact.lean`).
* `Refinement.separation_of_finer` : If a finer cover has separation (injective
  augmentation), then the coarser cover has separation too.
* `Refinement.cochainMap_comp_aug` : The augmentation commutes with the refinement
  cochain map.
* `IsSheafy.ofStronglyNoetherianTate_discrete` : Discrete rings are sheafy
  (via `IsSheafy.discrete`).

## Proof outline (Wedhorn pp.82-85)

1. **Laurent cover exactness** (Lemma 8.33): For any `f ∈ A`, the 2-element cover
   `{R(f/1), R(1/f)}` gives an exact Čech complex. (Proved in `LaurentCoverExact.lean`.)
2. **Flatness** (Lemma 8.31 + Prop 8.30): Restriction maps are flat, and the product
   restriction for a cover is faithfully flat. (Proved in `FlatnessResults.lean`.)
3. **Acyclicity propagation** (Lemma 8.34): Products of 2-element Laurent covers are
   acyclic, and every standard rational cover refines such a product.
4. **Refinement transfers separation** (Proposition A.3): If `V` refines `U` and `V`
   has separation, then `U` has separation.

## Current status

### Discrete case (complete, 0 sorry)
- Laurent cover exactness: `LaurentCoverExact.lean`
- Flatness: `FlatnessResults.lean`
- Discrete sheaf condition: `StructureSheaf.lean` (`IsSheafy.discrete`)
- Separation via refinement: proved below

### General (non-discrete) case (algebraic foundation complete)
The algebraic ingredients are all proved:
- Laurent cover injectivity via Krull intersection (`epsilonHom_gen_injective`)
- Row 2 exactness (`row2_exact_at_middle`)
- Tate algebra flatness (`flat_quotient_*_general`)

The remaining gaps for the general case are topological:
- **G2-topo**: Correct T-topology on Tate algebra (I-adic, not product topology)
- **Presheaf identification**: Full isomorphism `presheafValue D ≅ A⟨X⟩/(1-sX)`
- **Categorical wrapping**: Connecting `AbPresheaf`/`FiniteCover` to `RationalCovering`

/-! ### Class definition -/

/-- A Tate ring `A` is **strongly noetherian** (Definition 6.36 of Wedhorn) if the
restricted power series ring `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` is noetherian for every `k ≥ 0`.

Equivalently, every Tate ring topologically of finite type over `A` is noetherian.
This is stronger than just assuming `A` is noetherian. -/

/-- The 2-element Laurent cover `{R(f/1), R(1/f)}` yields an exact Čech complex
for discrete rings. This is the discrete case of Lemma 8.33.

The exact sequence `0 → A → B₁ × B₂ → B₁₂ → 0` where:
- `B₁ = A⟨X⟩/(f-X) ≅ A`
- `B₂ = A⟨X⟩/(1-fX) ≅ Localization.Away f`
- `B₁₂ ≅ Localization.Away f`

is proved in `LaurentCoverExact.lean`.

The 2-element Laurent cover is acyclic for discrete noetherian rings.

/-! ### Refinement transfers separation

This section proves the key abstract result: if a finer cover has separation
(injective augmentation), then the coarser cover has separation too.

This is the abstract version of Proposition A.3 of Wedhorn: if `V` refines `U`
and the Čech complex of `V` has separation, then the Čech complex of `U` has
separation.

**Direction convention.** `Refinement V U` means "V refines U" (V is finer):
each `V_j ⊆ U_{τ(j)}`. The cochain map goes `Cech(U) → Cech(V)`. The
augmentation commutes: `cochainMap(cechAug_U(x)) = cechAug_V(x)`.

**Key lemma.** If V refines U and V has separation (cechAug_V injective), then
U has separation (cechAug_U injective). Proof: if cechAug_U(x) = cechAug_U(y),
apply cochainMap to get cechAug_V(x) = cechAug_V(y), then V-separation gives x = y. -/

/-- The augmentation commutes with the refinement cochain map:
`r.cochainMap(cechAug(U)(x)) = cechAug(V)(x)`.

That is, restricting a global section first to `U`-pieces and then refining to
`V`-pieces gives the same result as restricting the global section directly to
`V`-pieces. This follows from functoriality of the presheaf restriction maps. -/

If `V` refines `U` (each `V_j ⊆ U_{τ(j)}`) and `V` has the separation property
(injective augmentation), then `U` also has the separation property.

**Proof.** If `cechAug(U)(x) = cechAug(U)(y)`, applying the refinement cochain
map gives `r.cochainMap(cechAug(U)(x)) = r.cochainMap(cechAug(U)(y))`. By
`cochainMap_comp_aug`, this becomes `cechAug(V)(x) = cechAug(V)(y)`. Since
`V` has separation, `x = y`. -/

/-! ### The chain from Laurent covers to IsSheafy

We document the complete logical chain from the Laurent cover exactness to the
sheaf condition, with each step either proved or precisely identified as a gap.

**Step 1** (DONE, 0 sorry): For each `f ∈ A`, the Laurent cover `{R(f/1), R(1/f)}`
has an exact Čech complex. In particular, `ε : A → B₁ × B₂` is injective.
- Discrete case: `LaurentCover.laurentCover_exact`
- General case: `LaurentCover.epsilonHom_gen_injective` (needs `¬IsUnit f`)
- Row 2: `LaurentCover.row2_exact_at_middle`

**Step 2** (DONE, 0 sorry for discrete; 4 sorry in saturation engine for general):
The quotient rings `B₁ = A⟨X⟩/(f-X)` and `B₂ = A⟨X⟩/(1-fX)` are flat over `A`.
- Discrete: `TateAlgebra.flat_quotient_fSubX`, `flat_quotient_oneSubfX`
- General: `flat_quotient_fSubX_general`, `flat_quotient_oneSubfX_general`

**Step 3** (DONE, 0 sorry): Refinement preserves separation.
- `Refinement.separation_of_finer`

**Step 4** (GAP — requires Lemma 7.54 + categorical wrapping): Every standard
rational covering is refined by a product of Laurent covers. This requires:
- Decomposing rational subsets `R(T/s)` into basic pieces (Lemma 7.54)
- Constructing `FiniteCover` from `RationalCovering`
- Wrapping `presheafValue` as an `AbPresheaf`
- Connecting `IsSeparating` to `productRestriction` injectivity

**Step 5** (DONE for discrete via direct proof): Separation for all rational
coverings gives `IsSheafy`.
- Discrete: `productRestriction_injective_discrete` in `Presheaf.lean`
- General: follows from Steps 1-4 once Step 4 is complete

For the discrete case, Steps 4 and 5 are bypassed by the direct proof
`productRestriction_injective_discrete` which uses a different argument
(trivial valuations at primes + radical ideal membership).
-/

/-! ### Faithful flatness perspective (Corollary 8.32)

For the general (non-discrete) case, the most direct route to `IsSheafy` goes
through faithful flatness rather than Čech cohomology:

1. Each presheaf value `presheafValue Dᵢ` is flat over `A` (Proposition 8.30).
2. The product `∏ presheafValue Dᵢ` is flat over `A` (products of flat modules).
3. The product is faithfully flat because the covering {R(Tᵢ/sᵢ)} covers Spec A
   (the `sᵢ` generate the unit ideal).
4. Faithfully flat maps are injective, giving `IsSheafy`.

For step 1, the flatness of `presheafValue D` follows from:
- The identification `presheafValue D ≅ completion of Localization.Away D.s`
- Localization is flat (Mathlib: `Localization.flat`)
- Completion of flat is flat for noetherian rings (Mathlib: `AdicCompletion.flat`)

For step 3, the surjectivity on spectra follows from the covering condition.

The abstract faithful flatness results are available in Mathlib
(`Module.FaithfullyFlat`). What's needed to complete the general proof is the
topological identification connecting `presheafValue` to `Localization.Away`
(or to the Tate algebra quotients).

/-! ### General case: specification of remaining work

The general (non-discrete) proof of Theorem 8.28(b) requires assembling the
algebraic foundations with three additional components:

**Component A (Topological identification):** Show that for a Tate ring `A`
with pair of definition `(A₀, I)`, the presheaf value `presheafValue D` is
isomorphic (as a topological ring) to the completion of `Localization.Away D.s`
with respect to the `I`-adic topology. This requires:
- Defining the correct T-topology on `A⟨X⟩` (I-adic, not restricted product)
- Proving that `A⟨X⟩/(1-sX)` with the quotient topology equals the adic completion
- Building the chain: presheafValue D ← completion ← A⟨X⟩/(1-sX) quotient

**Component B (Categorical wrapping):** Connect the `RationalCovering` / `presheafValue`
framework (from `Presheaf.lean`) to the `FiniteCover` / `AbPresheaf` / `IsSeparating`
framework (from `CechCohomology.lean`). This requires:
- Constructing `FiniteCover (Spa A A⁺) ι` from `RationalCovering A`
- Wrapping `presheafValue` into an `AbPresheaf (Spa A A⁺)`
- Showing `IsSeparating F U` (Čech separation) ↔ `Function.Injective (productRestriction)`

**Component C (Laurent-to-standard refinement):** Prove that every standard rational
covering is refined by a product of 2-element Laurent covers. This requires:
- Lemma 7.54: decomposition of rational subsets into basic pieces
- For basic `R(tᵢ/s)`: showing it equals `R(tᵢ/1) ∩ R(1/s)` (set-theoretic intersection)
- Constructing the refinement map from the product cover to the standard cover

Once Components A, B, C are in place, the proof assembles as:
