# Nonarchimedean Scottish Book — Problem 8

**Proposer:** Kiran Kedlaya
**Date:** 18 December 2015

## Problem Statement

Let (A, A+) be a Huber pair. Is sheafiness or stable uniformity independent of the choice
of A+?

## Notes

None.

## Status

RESOLVED: Yes, both sheafiness and stable uniformity are independent of A+.
- Hansen proved independence of stable uniformity.
- Gabber proved independence of sheafiness.

## Definitions needed

- **Independence of A+**: The property that sheafiness/stable uniformity of (A, A+) does
  not depend on the choice of the ring of integral elements A+ (already formalized as
  `PlusSubring` in this project).

/-! ### Independence of A⁺

The key challenge is that `IsSheafy` and `IsStablyUniform` depend on a `PlusSubring A`
instance (which determines `A⁺`) and a `HasRestrictionMaps A` instance. To state
"independent of A⁺", we parameterize by two different `PlusSubring` instances and their
corresponding `HasRestrictionMaps` instances.

/-- **Scottish Book Problem 8a** (Kedlaya, resolved by Gabber):
*Sheafiness is independent of the choice of A⁺.*

Given two choices of rings of integral elements `A⁺₁` and `A⁺₂` for the same
topological ring `A`, if `(A, A⁺₁)` is sheafy then so is `(A, A⁺₂)`. -/

*Stable uniformity is independent of the choice of A⁺.*

Given two choices of rings of integral elements `A⁺₁` and `A⁺₂` for the same
topological ring `A`, if `(A, A⁺₁)` is stably uniform then so is `(A, A⁺₂)`. -/
