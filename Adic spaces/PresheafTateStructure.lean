# Tate Ring Structure on Presheaf Values (Wedhorn Proposition 8.15)

For a strongly noetherian Tate ring `(A, A⁺)` with pair of definition `(A₀, I)`,
and a rational localization datum `D₀`, the presheaf value `presheafValue D₀`
carries a natural Tate ring structure:

- **Ring of definition**: The closure of `locSubring` in the completion
- **Ideal of definition**: The closure of `locIdeal` in the completion
- **Topologically nilpotent unit**: The image of the pseudo-uniformizer from A

This enables the "localization principle": the structure presheaf on a rational
subset `R(T/s)` is the structure presheaf of the Tate ring `presheafValue D₀`.

## Main results

* `presheafValue_isTateRing` : `IsTateRing (presheafValue D₀)` (TODO)
* `presheafValue_pairOfDefinition` : The natural pair of definition (TODO)
* `presheafValue_topNilUnit` : Topologically nilpotent unit in presheafValue

/-! ### Topologically nilpotent unit in presheafValue

If A has a topologically nilpotent unit π (i.e., A is a Tate ring), then
the image of π under canonicalMap is a topologically nilpotent unit in
presheafValue D₀. This is because:
- canonicalMap is a ring hom, so it preserves units
- canonicalMap is continuous, so it preserves topological nilpotency -/

/-- A topologically nilpotent unit in A maps to a topologically nilpotent
unit in `presheafValue D₀` via `canonicalMap`. -/

    ∃ u : (presheafValue D₀)ˣ, IsTopologicallyNilpotent (u : presheafValue D₀) := by
  -- Get the topologically nilpotent unit from A
  obtain ⟨π, hπ⟩ := IsTateRing.exists_topologicallyNilpotent_unit (A := A)
  -- Map π to presheafValue D₀ via canonicalMap
  have hunit : IsUnit (D₀.canonicalMap (π : A)) := (π.isUnit).map D₀.canonicalMap

  -- canonicalMap preserves topological nilpotency (continuous MonoidWithZero hom)
  -- canonicalMap = coeRingHom ∘ algebraMap
  -- Both are continuous, so the composition is continuous
  -- IsTopologicallyNilpotent.map gives the result
  -- canonicalMap = coeRingHom ∘ algebraMap, need continuity
  -- coeRingHom is the completion embedding (uniformly continuous → continuous)
  -- algebraMap : A → Localization.Away s needs continuity for the localization topology
  sorry -- Needs: continuity of canonicalMap = coeRingHom ∘ algebraMap

/-! ### Pair of definition in presheafValue

The natural pair of definition for `presheafValue D₀`:
- **Ring of definition**: The image of `locSubring` under `coeRingHom`
  (the completion of locSubring sits inside presheafValue as a subring)
- **Ideal of definition**: The image of `locIdeal` under the lifted map

For a Noetherian locSubring with locIdeal-adic topology:
- The completion of locSubring = AdicCompletion(locIdeal, locSubring) (bridge)
- This is a complete open subring of presheafValue
- The image of locIdeal generates the topology

TODO: Construct and verify this pair of definition. -/

-- Placeholder for the pair of definition construction
-- This requires:
-- 1. Embedding the completion of locSubring into presheafValue
-- 2. Showing the embedding has open image
-- 3. Showing the image of locIdeal is finitely generated
-- 4. Showing the subspace topology is I-adic
