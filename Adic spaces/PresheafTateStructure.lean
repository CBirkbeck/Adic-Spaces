# Tate Ring Structure on Presheaf Values (Wedhorn Proposition 8.15)

For a strongly noetherian Tate ring `(A, A⁺)` with pair of definition `(A₀, I)`,
and a rational localization datum `D₀`, the presheaf value `presheafValue D₀`
carries a natural Tate ring structure:

- **Ring of definition**: The closure of `locSubring` in the completion
- **Ideal of definition**: The closure of `locIdeal` in the completion
- **Topologically nilpotent unit**: The image of the pseudo-uniformizer from A

This enables the "localization principle": the structure presheaf on a rational
subset `R(T/s)` is the structure presheaf of the Tate ring `presheafValue D₀`.

## Main results

* `presheafValue_isTateRing` : `IsTateRing (presheafValue D₀)` (TODO)
* `presheafValue_pairOfDefinition` : The natural pair of definition (TODO)
* `presheafValue_topNilUnit` : Topologically nilpotent unit in presheafValue

/-! ### Topologically nilpotent unit in presheafValue

If A has a topologically nilpotent unit π (i.e., A is a Tate ring), then
the image of π under canonicalMap is a topologically nilpotent unit in
presheafValue D₀. This is because:
- canonicalMap is a ring hom, so it preserves units
- canonicalMap is continuous, so it preserves topological nilpotency -/

/-- A topologically nilpotent unit in A maps to a topologically nilpotent
unit in `presheafValue D₀` via `canonicalMap`. -/

    ∃ u : (presheafValue D₀)ˣ, IsTopologicallyNilpotent (u : presheafValue D₀) := by

/-! ### Pair of definition in presheafValue

The natural pair of definition for `presheafValue D₀`:
- **Ring of definition**: The image of `locSubring` under `coeRingHom`
  (the completion of locSubring sits inside presheafValue as a subring)
- **Ideal of definition**: The image of `locIdeal` under the lifted map

For a Noetherian locSubring with locIdeal-adic topology:
- The completion of locSubring = AdicCompletion(locIdeal, locSubring) (bridge)
- This is a complete open subring of presheafValue
- The image of locIdeal generates the topology

TODO: Construct and verify this pair of definition. -/

/-- The ring of definition inside `presheafValue D₀`: the closure of
`locSubring` in the completion. This is the image of the AdicCompletion
of `locSubring` (via the bridge) embedded into the completion of the
ambient localization.

For Noetherian locSubring with locIdeal-adic topology: the closure
= Completion(locSubring) = AdicCompletion(locIdeal, locSubring). -/

This follows from locSubring being open in the localization topology:
its image under coeRingHom is open in the completion topology (open
